<h3> History </h3>
Founded as a free undertaking, iunv has shown tremendous growth in a short time.
It was founded on 24th May, 2012 and was launched to public on 26th May, 2012.<br><br>
we started off with offering a social network powered by the Jcow, and we eventually expanded to the games, marketing and news section.<hr>
<h3> Present </h3>
As our memberbase grew exponentially, we had to recently move on to paid hosting, and thanks to the few donations we get, our services still cost nothing!<br><br>

<h3> Future </h3>
In short future, we plan to launch a search engine and also to provide email service. We also plan to enter the world of advertising networks. Keep out the eye! <hr>
